  <h1>Intro to Js</h1>
  <p>This course started the learning process of javascript it tought me how to
  use shapes to draw, using loops, arrays and objects in javascript. This course
still has potentional since it is the basic of javascript and I can and I will use
it ever time I write in javascript. I feel like arrays and object are the most
important aspect of this course since it is the most thing that I have
been using and the are one of the advaced things that we can learn since its
potentional does not stop their but it continue to games and other type of coding</p>
