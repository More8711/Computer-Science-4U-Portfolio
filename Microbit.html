  <h1 class="bar">Microbit</h1>
  <p>I learned a good amount from the microbit project since it was one of the first
  times that I used another tool to learn from and to play with. This tool can be
very useful since it is not only microbits but there are other hardware that can be
modifided with code to do cool things. Most important aspect is that we tryed
a new thing which is combining code with hardware and we used bluetooth to transmit
waves to send information to the microbit.</p>
