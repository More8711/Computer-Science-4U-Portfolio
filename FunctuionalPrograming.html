  <h1 class="bar">Functional Programming</h1>
  <p>Functions are widely used in Computer Science it is very useful since it
  optimizes coding and makes it easier and faster to make. I can learn alot from
functions since there are specific functions assigned to variables which is a wide topic
also functions are comonly used in Computer Science since they are a good tool to
use making someone's code shorter and easier to follow and correct in case of any
mistakes. The most signficant part of this course is the combination of strings
arrays and other types of variables so the product can be creative and non repatative.</p>
