  <h1 class="bar"> Basic HTML </h1>
  <p>Making websites is very useful speialy as a highschooler since it can be used
  in other subjects, what I learned in this course is very basic but it was useful
to start with. To continue learning this course I can practice making websites and
go online find more tools that will expand my knowledge of HTML. Most imprtant aspect
is the course itself since it teaches the user the basic needs to start a website.</p>
