  <h1 class="bar">Object Orinted Programming</h1>
  <p>Objects are a very comonly used tool in javascript since it is very useful.
  Objects are widely used since they can be made into multiple entities easily.
I can use Object Orinted Programming to create art and animation since it is a very
widely spread and I can come up with new ideas also it teaches me new things and
expand my knowledge with Object Orinted Programming. I feel like prototypes are a
very import and signficant part of Object Orinted Programming due to the fact that
you can start with and object and make new prototypes to inherat from the parent function
but adds a new aspect to the program, with inherats there are endless posiblities. Prototypes
are also used to create Natural Simulations which represnt real life since the object
can easily be modifided to be better and to inherat gravity and other aspects of real life
physics.</p>
