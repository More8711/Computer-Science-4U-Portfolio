  <h2>Debbuging</h2>
  <p>One of the most important things in codingis debbuging since anything can go wrong
  with the code and the programer has to fix it. Learning how to debbug is an important
part but it comes from practice and a very good way is coding and if something goes
wrong fix it, another way is to look at other people's code and fix it, not only you
are practicing but you are helping others which intern will grow the community.
This course as a whole is signficant since it teachs the user a very important skill.</p>
